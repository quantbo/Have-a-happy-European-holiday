# Have-a-happy-European-holiday

As of December 2016 the dollar is strong against the major European currencies. This makes it a good time to take a European holiday.

It is also a good time to consider how best to display time series (in this case daily currency time series) when there are lots of gaps in the data. I conclude that bar charts are more realistic than line graphs when almost 1/3 of the data are missing. Interactive time series bar charts for Euros per Dollar and Pounds per Dollar are displayed.
